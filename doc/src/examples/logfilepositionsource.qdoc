    \title Log File Position Source Example

    This example demonstrates the replaying of position data from a log file.

    The data is read from a file which has positional data in NMEA format. The resulting
    time and position information is then displayed to the screen as simple text in
    date/time and latitude/longitude format.

    A detailed analysis is given in the overview documentation for the \l {Location API}.
